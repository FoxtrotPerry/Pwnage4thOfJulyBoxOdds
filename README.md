# Pwnage4thOfJulyBoxOdds _(WIP)_
The goal of this small repo is to accurately predict the odds of getting any product included in the [Pwnage's 4th of July Lucky Box](https://pwnage.com/products/july-4th-celebration-lucky-box) event.

The mechanism used to choose the items put into each mystery box in this simulator was stripped from Pwnage's 4th of July event web page and is just basically hotwired to work in an offline environment.

More info to come (assuming I don't forget to update this...)
